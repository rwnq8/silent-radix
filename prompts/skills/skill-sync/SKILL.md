name: skill-sync
description: Sync all DeepChat skills between local disk, GitHub, and Cloudflare R2. Monitors skill modifications and auto-syncs after changes. Updates Discovery Index with current versions. Use when skills are modified and need to be pushed to redundant backups, or to check sync status.
version: "1.3"

> **INCLUDES AUTONOMOUS RED-TEAM SELF-AUDIT.** See RED-TEAM-PROTOCOL.md.



### Programmatic Loading & Execution
This skill is loaded and executed **programmatically by the LLM system** 
during response generation. Loading is triggered automatically via 
`skill_view('skill-sync')` or `read()` with filesystem path.
**The user NEVER manually loads this skill.** The `skill-autoloader` 
detects task patterns and handles all skill loading. If this skill fails 
to load, the LLM system automatically retries via the fallback chain 
documented below.
**Pinning:** This skill is [On-demand — loads when triggered by task patterns].

### Skill Loading Retry Protocol
If `skill_view('name')` fails during programmatic loading, the LLM system 
MUST execute this fallback chain:
1. **Retry 1:** `read('%USERPROFILE%\.deepchat\skills\<name>\SKILL.md')`
2. **Retry 2:** Pull from Cloudflare R2: `npx wrangler r2 object get 
   qnfo/prompts/skills/<name>/SKILL.md --remote --file=_skill.md`
3. **Retry 3:** If R2 fails, search local filesystem for any cached copy
4. **Fallback:** If ALL retries fail, continue with `[SKILL-UNAVAILABLE: <name>]` 
   and best-effort knowledge
**NEVER silently proceed without a skill's critical instructions.** If a skill 
is required for the task and cannot be loaded after 3 retries, escalate to 
the user with the specific failure reason.

# SKILL SYNC SKILL — v1.3

> **On-demand skill. AUTO-GAP-AUDIT INTEGRATION.** Load via `skill_view('skill-sync')` to sync skills or check sync status. Automatically triggers gap audit (closeout-manager §2.6) after sync completion.

---

## Purpose

Skills are modified locally but must be pushed to GitHub and R2 for redundancy. This skill automates the three-way sync, updates the Discovery Index with current versions, and **triggers the POST-PHASE GAP AUDIT** to verify no desync or drift remains.

## When to Use

| Trigger | Action |
|:--------|:-------|
| After any skill modification | "SYNC SKILLS" or use bootstrap_skills.py → auto-triggers gap audit |
| "Are skills in sync?" | Check sync status report → auto-triggers gap audit if desync found |
| "Push skills to GitHub/R2" | Selective sync → auto-verifies R2 + DI |
| Before session closeout | Auto-sync check → feeds into closeout gap audit |

## Quick Sync (One Command)

```bash
python "%USERPROFILE%\.deepchat\skills\bootstrap_skills.py" --sync
```

This:
1. Commits and pushes all skill changes to GitHub (`rwnq8/qnfo-skills`)
2. Uploads all skills to R2 (`qnfo/prompts/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`)
3. Reports sync status
4. **AUTO-TRIGGERS gap audit** (closeout-manager §2.6) — verifies R2, GitHub, and DI consistency

## Sync Status Check

```python
import os, urllib.request

TOKEN = os.environ.get('CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN', '')
ACCOUNT = 'edb167b78c9fb901ea5bca3ce58ccc4b'
SKILLS_DIR = os.path.expandvars(r'%USERPROFILE%\.deepchat\skills')

local_skills = []
for d in sorted(os.listdir(SKILLS_DIR)):
    p = os.path.join(SKILLS_DIR, d, 'SKILL.md')
    if os.path.isfile(p) and not d.startswith('.'):
        local_skills.append(d)

# Sample-check 5 skills against R2 for drift
drift = 0
for name in local_skills[:5]:
    local_size = os.path.getsize(os.path.join(SKILLS_DIR, name, 'SKILL.md'))
    url = f'https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{ACCOUNT}/r2/buckets/qnfo/objects/qnfo/prompts/skills/{name}/SKILL.md'
    req = urllib.request.Request(url)
    req.add_header('Authorization', f'Bearer {TOKEN}')
    try:
        resp = urllib.request.urlopen(req, timeout=10)
        r2_size = len(resp.read())
        status = 'SYNCED' if r2_size == local_size else 'DRIFT'
        if status == 'DRIFT':
            drift += 1
        print(f'  {name}: {status} (local={local_size}, r2={r2_size})')
    except:
        print(f'  {name}: R2 MISSING')

status = 'DRIFT DETECTED — run bootstrap_skills.py --sync' if drift else 'IN SYNC'
print(f'\nSync Status: {status}')
```

## Bootstrap Tools

Must exist locally for this skill to work:
- `bootstrap_skills.py` — One-command sync tool (located at `%USERPROFILE%\.deepchat\skills\bootstrap_skills.py`)
- Recoverable from R2: `qnfo/tools/bootstrap_skills.py`
- Recoverable from GitHub: `rwnq8/qnfo-skills/blob/master/bootstrap_skills.py`

## Auto-Gap-Audit Integration (v1.3)

After sync completes (GitHub + R2), this skill automatically triggers the POST-PHASE GAP AUDIT (closeout-manager §2.6):
1. Verify R2 sync count matches local count
2. Verify GitHub HEAD matches local commit
3. Verify Discovery Index is updated with current versions
4. Report any desync or drift as gaps

## Mandatory Post-Sync Restart

**Rule:** After any successful skill sync (push to GitHub + R2), DeepChat MUST be restarted programmatically. Skills are loaded at application startup; changes made via sync do not take effect until DeepChat is killed and relaunched.

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.deepchat\skills\skill-sync\scripts\restart_deepchat.ps1"
```

This kills all old DeepChat processes and launches a fresh instance. Execute this as the final step after confirming sync success. The current conversation will terminate.

*skill-sync v1.3 — Monitors and syncs skills between local, GitHub, and R2. Auto-gap-audit integration. Paths corrected (%USERPROFILE%\.deepchat\skills). Includes mandatory post-sync restart.*

## RT: RED-TEAM SELF-AUDIT

Before claiming this skill complete, autonomously run:

1. Output Verification (negative verification)
2. Assumption Challenge (state and test every assumption)
3. Edge Case Check (empty/null/max/boundary/desync)
4. DoD Integration (run _dod_enforce.py if exists)
5. Iteration (retry on failure, max 3)

ANTI-PATTERN: User should NEVER ask about quality.
Refer to RED-TEAM-PROTOCOL.md for full protocol.
